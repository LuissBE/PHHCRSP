# PHHCRSP
Repository containing source code for the routing and assignment heuristic developed for my Bachelor thesis.

## Routing model
Source code

This is the windows version of the program. Has been compiled with visual studio 2017. Source files are in standard c++ Running the solver

ILP_PHHCRSP Instances <input_file> <solution_file> <random_seed>

For example, the command line:

ILP_PHHCRSP Instances 0407-8-50-5-1.txt -m 3 -t 600 -o 4 -c 8 -t 60 -v

Command Syntax ILP_PHHCRSP <input_file> -m -t <time_limit> -o <output_option> -c <constraint_option> -t <secondary_time_limit> -v

Parameters <input_file>: Specifies the path to the input file containing the instances to be processed. Example: 0407-8-50-5-1.txt.

-m : Sets the mode of operation. The mode 3 is used in the example command.

-t <time_limit>: Defines the primary time limit (in seconds) for the operation. Note that -t appears twice in the command, which seems to be a mistake. The first occurrence sets a time limit of 600 seconds.

-o <output_option>: Selects the output option. In the example, 4 specifies the type of output generated by the tool.

-c <constraint_option>: Determines the constraint option to be applied during processing. The example uses 8 as the constraint setting.

-t <secondary_time_limit>: Appears to be incorrectly repeated. Ideally, each option should be distinct. Assuming the second -t aims to set a different parameter (like a secondary time limit), it's set to 60 seconds in the example.

-v visualize the final solution. Requires SFML 3.0.0 to be installed and correctly configured.

## Assignment model
Source code

This is the windows version of the program. Has been compiled with visual studio 2017. Source files are in standard c++ Running the solver

ILP_PHHCRSP Instances <input_file> <solution_file> <random_seed>

For example, the command line:

ILP_PHHCRSP Instances 0407-8-50-5-1.txt -m 1 -o 4 -c 8 -t 60 -l 600 -v

Command Syntax ILP_PHHCRSP <input_file> -m <mode_option> -o <output_option> -c <constraint_option> -t <gurobi_time_limit> -l -t <total_time_limit> -v

Parameters <input_file>: Specifies the path to the input file containing the instances to be processed. Example: 0407-8-50-5-1.txt.

-m : Sets the mode of operation. The mode 3 is used in the example command.

-t <gurobi_time_limit>: Defines the time limit for the solver during the initial assignment phase.

-l <total_time_limit>: Defines the total time limit for the entire heuristic.

-o <output_option>: Selects the output option. In the example, 4 specifies the type of output generated by the tool.

-c <constraint_option>: Determines the constraint option to be applied during processing. The example uses 8 as the constraint setting.

-t <secondary_time_limit>: Appears to be incorrectly repeated. Ideally, each option should be distinct. Assuming the second -t aims to set a different parameter (like a secondary time limit), it's set to 60 seconds in the example.

-v visualize the final solution. Requires SFML 3.0.0 to be installed and correctly configured.
